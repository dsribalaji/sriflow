## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed: `Bash` (read-only), `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, writes to `SRIFLOW_MEMORY.md`, and writes to the plan file. No destructive file operations or git mutations in plan mode.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes this skill in plan mode, follow it step by step starting from Phase 1. AskUserQuestion satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. At a STOP point, stop immediately. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes.

If `SRIFLOW_PLAN_MODE` is `"active"`: do not run destructive ops. Read files, analyze, report findings, write to plan file.

## AskUserQuestion Format

Every AskUserQuestion is a decision brief:

```
D<N> — <one-line question title>
Branch: <_BRANCH value>
ELI10: <plain English, 2-4 sentences, name the stakes>
Stakes if wrong: <one sentence on what breaks>
Recommendation: <choice> because <one-line reason>
Completeness: A=X/10, B=Y/10
A) <option> (recommended)
  ✅ <pro, ≥40 chars>
  ❌ <con, ≥40 chars>
B) <option>
  ✅ <pro>
  ❌ <con>
Net: <one-line synthesis of the tradeoff>
```

D-numbering: first question is `D1`; increment per question.
ELI10 always present. Recommendation always present. (recommended) on exactly one option.

If AskUserQuestion is unavailable: render as prose with same triad (ELI10, completeness, recommendation), then STOP.
