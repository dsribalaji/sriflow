## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed: `Bash` (read-only), `Read`, `WebFetch` (read-only), writes to `SRIFLOW_MEMORY.md`, and writes to the plan file. No destructive file operations or git mutations.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes this skill in plan mode, follow it step by step. AskUserQuestion satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. At a STOP point, stop immediately. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes.

If `SRIFLOW_PLAN_MODE` is `"active"`: read-only operations only. Analyze, report findings, write to plan file.
